Party Planning with Monte Carlo Simulation

Click here --> [notebook](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/lyonsquark/partyPlanningMC/blob/master/partySimulation.html) To see the notebook formatted nicely. 

You can run the notebook in the cloud using a free service called [mybinder](http://mybinder.org) by clicking on this little launch badge --> [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/lyonsquark/partyPlanningMC/master?filepath=partySimulation.ipynb)
If the environment needs to be created, that build can take a very long time. Click on the little "show" button by "Build logs" to see what's going on. Just give it time and it will eventually finish. Pauses in the build log are ok. Once the environment is built, then subsequent launches should be much faster.
